What your site does and what its purpose.

	My site is a quiz game where you guess the . I remember there being something similar when I went to a baseball/football game when I was younger and I remembered it being fun so I decided to make my own spin on the concept.

How can this app be profitable? What profit model (ads, service, microtransactions, etc) are you considering?



How are you using React? What is it being used to show?



How you used MVC and which framework you used



What you used Mongo for (what did you store/retrieve)



How you used a templating language and which templating language you used

	I used DomoMaker E as my base and didn't change Handlebars as my templating language. My main use for it was confinining my entire app to only two pages, to make everything feel more seemless

How did you go above and beyond

	-I made the game look as visually appealing as I could
	-Nothing just loads onto the page. Everything is animated on startup.
